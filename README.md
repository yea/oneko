The ever popular kitty-that-follows-your-mouse-pointer toy.

Neko is Japanese for cat. According to  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neko_(software)) it was originally written for the NEC PC-9801.

This fork removes the annoying windowed mode toggle & adds a system tray icon to exit instead.

Jar file included, but you should look at the code build the project yourself.
